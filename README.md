# AI vs Human Text Fine-Tuned Classifier 

## About the Project

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model capable of distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated text. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini, the ability to identify the origin of a text has become crucial in various domains, including academic integrity, content moderation, misinformation detection, and authorship verification. The project leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques and transfer learning to build a binary classifier that can accurately predict whether a given text was authored by a human or generated by an AI.

The workflow encompasses comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), advanced text preprocessing, model selection and fine-tuning, and thorough evaluation. The final model is designed to be easily deployable and accessible for real-world applications.

## About the Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: [AI vs Human Text Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shanegerami/ai-vs-human-text). It contains a large collection of text samples, each labeled as either human-written or AI-generated. The dataset is well-suited for binary classification tasks and provides a diverse range of topics and writing styles, making it ideal for training and evaluating models that need to generalize across different types of content.

- **Features:**
  - `text`: The actual text sample.
  - `generated`: Label indicating the source (0 for human, 1 for AI).

The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to ensure unbiased evaluation and robust model performance.

## Notebook Summary

The main notebook, `ai_vs_human_text_fine_tuned_classifier.ipynb`, guides users through the entire process of building the classifier:

1. **Problem Definition:** Outlines the motivation and objectives.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes class distributions, text lengths, lexical richness, punctuation usage, and stopword ratios to uncover patterns and differences between human and AI texts.
3. **Text Preprocessing:** Applies normalization, stopword removal, noise filtering (removing URLs, emails, hashtags, mentions, numbers), and filters out outlier texts based on length.
4. **Model Selection:** Utilizes transfer learning with the `distilbert/distilroberta-base` model, enhanced with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficient fine-tuning.
5. **Training:** Fine-tunes the model on a subset of the data, using stratified splits and advanced training arguments for optimal performance.
6. **Evaluation:** Assesses the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a held-out test set.
7. **Deployment:** Demonstrates how to push the trained model and tokenizer to Hugging Face Hub for sharing and reuse.

## Model Results

### Preprocessing

- **Lowercasing and Stripping:** All text is converted to lowercase and stripped of extra whitespace.
- **Punctuation and Stopword Removal:** Punctuation is removed, and stopwords are filtered out to focus on meaningful content.
- **Noise Filtering:** Regular expressions are used to remove URLs, emails, hashtags, mentions, and numbers.
- **Outlier Filtering:** Texts that are extremely short or long (based on quantiles) are removed to ensure consistent input lengths for the model.
- **Deduplication:** Duplicate texts are dropped to prevent data leakage.

### Training

- **Model Architecture:** The project uses `distilbert/distilroberta-base`, a distilled version of RoBERTa, known for its efficiency and strong performance on text classification tasks.
- **LoRA Fine-Tuning:** LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is applied to reduce the number of trainable parameters, making the fine-tuning process more memory- and compute-efficient without sacrificing accuracy.
- **Training Arguments:** The model is trained for 2 epochs with early stopping, regular evaluation, and checkpointing. Batch sizes and learning rates are carefully chosen for stability and speed.

### Evaluation

- **Metrics:** The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the classifier's performance, especially in distinguishing between the two classes.
- **Results:** The fine-tuned model demonstrates strong performance, with high accuracy and balanced precision/recall, indicating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
